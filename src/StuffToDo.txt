So we have a lot to do:
    Actually read the images from the video
    Apply filter
    show them
Luckily for us, the filters are all created with an interface, so dealing with that should (hopefully) be easy
Though, never doubt the power of Apple Inc. to make it harder for us.
I just hope that this can be made to be fast
